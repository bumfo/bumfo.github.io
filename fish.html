<h1># Welcome to Fish</h1>
<p>Fish is a beautiful, flexible writing app for notes. </p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>## Safe Everywhere</h2>
<p>Your notes are saved automatically and that’s why there are no save button. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fish uses nothing for sync, thus all your notes are absolutely safe from hackers on the internet. However, Fish cannot guarantee the security of your notes if your device itself isn’t safe. </p>
